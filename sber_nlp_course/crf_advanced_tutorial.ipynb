Another example of a dynamic\n","kit is `Dynet <https://github.com/clab/dynet>`__ (I mention this because\n","working with Pytorch and Dynet is similar. If you see an example in\n","Dynet, it will probably help you implement it in Pytorch). The opposite\n","is the *static* tool kit, which includes Theano, Keras, TensorFlow, etc.\n","The core difference is the following:\n","\n","* In a static toolkit, you define\n","  a computation graph once, compile it, and then stream instances to it.\n","* In a dynamic toolkit, you define a computation graph *for each\n","  instance*. It is never compiled and is executed on-the-fly\n","\n","Without a lot of experience, it is difficult to appreciate the\n","difference. One example is to suppose we want to build a deep\n","constituent parser. Suppose our model involves roughly the following\n","steps:\n","\n","* We build the tree bottom up\n","* Tag the root nodes (the words of the sentence)\n","* From there, use a neural network and the embeddings\n","  of the words to find combinations that form constituents. Whenever you\n","  form a new constituent, use some sort of technique to get an embedding\n","  of the constituent. In this case, our network architecture will depend\n","  completely on the input sentence. In the sentence \"The green cat\n","  scratched the wall\", at some point in the model, we will want to combine\n","  the span $(i,j,r) = (1, 3, \\text{NP})$ (that is, an NP constituent\n","  spans word 1 to word 3, in this case \"The green cat\").\n","\n","However, another sentence might be \"Somewhere, the big fat cat scratched\n","the wall\". In this sentence, we will want to form the constituent\n","$(2, 4, NP)$ at some point. The constituents we will want to form\n","will depend on the instance. If we just compile the computation graph\n","once, as in a static toolkit, it will be exceptionally difficult or\n","impossible to program this logic. In a dynamic toolkit though, there\n","isn't just 1 pre-defined computation graph. There can be a new\n","computation graph for each instance, so this problem goes away.\n","\n","Dynamic toolkits also have the advantage of being easier to debug and\n","the code more closely resembling the host language (by that I mean that\n","Pytorch and Dynet look more like actual Python code than Keras or\n","Theano).\n","\n","Bi-LSTM Conditional Random Field Discussion\n","-------------------------------------------\n","\n","For this section, we will see a full, complicated example of a Bi-LSTM\n","Conditional Random Field for named-entity recognition. The LSTM tagger\n","above is typically sufficient for part-of-speech tagging, but a sequence\n","model like the CRF is really essential for strong performance on NER.\n","Familiarity with CRF's is assumed. Although this name sounds scary, all\n","the model is a CRF but where an LSTM provides the features. This is\n","an advanced model though, far more complicated than any earlier model in\n","this tutorial. If you want to skip it, that is fine. To see if you're\n","ready, see if you can:\n","\n","-  Write the recurrence for the viterbi variable at step i for tag k.\n","-  Modify the above recurrence to compute the forward variables instead.\n","-  Modify again the above recurrence to compute the forward variables in\n","   log-space (hint: log-sum-exp)\n","\n","If you can do those three things, you should be able to understand the\n","code below. Recall that the CRF computes a conditional probability. Let\n","$y$ be a tag sequence and $x$ an input sequence of words.\n","Then we compute\n","\n","\\begin{align}P(y|x) = \\frac{\\exp{(\\text{Score}(x, y)})}{\\sum_{y'} \\exp{(\\text{Score}(x, y')})}\\end{align}\n","\n","Where the score is determined by defining some log potentials\n","$\\log \\psi_i(x,y)$ such that\n","\n","\\begin{align}\\text{Score}(x,y) = \\sum_i \\log \\psi_i(x,y)\\end{align}\n","\n","To make the partition function tractable, the potentials must look only\n","at local features.\n","\n","In the Bi-LSTM CRF, we define two kinds of potentials: emission and\n","transition. The emission potential for the word at index $i$ comes\n","from the hidden state of the Bi-LSTM at timestep $i$. The\n","transition scores are stored in a $|T|x|T|$ matrix\n","$\\textbf{P}$, where $T$ is the tag set. In my\n","implementation, $\\textbf{P}_{j,k}$ is the score of transitioning\n","to tag $j$ from tag $k$. So:\n","\n","\\begin{align}\\text{Score}(x,y) = \\sum_i \\log \\psi_\\text{EMIT}(y_i \\rightarrow x_i) + \\log \\psi_\\text{TRANS}(y_{i-1} \\rightarrow y_i)\\end{align}\n","\n","\\begin{align}= \\sum_i h_i[y_i] + \\textbf{P}_{y_i, y_{i-1}}\\end{align}\n","\n","where in this second expression, we think of the tags as being assigned\n","unique non-negative indices.\n","\n","If the above discussion was too brief, you can check out\n","`this <http://www.cs.columbia.edu/%7Emcollins/crf.pdf>`__ write up from\n","Michael Collins on CRFs.\n","\n","Implementation Notes\n","--------------------\n","\n","The example below implements the forward algorithm in log space to\n","compute the partition function, and the viterbi algorithm to decode.\n","Backpropagation will compute the gradients automatically for us. We\n","don't have to do anything by hand.\n","\n","The implementation is not optimized. If you understand what is going on,\n","you'll probably quickly see that iterating over the next tag in the\n","forward algorithm could probably be done in one big operation. I wanted\n","to code to be more readable. If you want to make the relevant change,\n","you could probably use this tagger for real tasks.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"2mDFqc4dKzsP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649682417591,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":5792,"user":{"displayName":"Константин Шитьков","userId":"04248095687395188930"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch\n","import torch.autograd as autograd\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.optim as optim"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["torch.manual_seed(1)"],"metadata":{"id":"iWwpmRRDL8tO","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649682417592,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Константин Шитьков","userId":"04248095687395188930"}},"outputId":"9c7b95c1-c91e-4dfc-ebf0-c8cac876df81"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["<torch._C.Generator at 0x7f6d93190050>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_nf1Fat5KzsR"},"source":["Helper functions to make the code more readable.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"id":"tqDJtKIyKzsS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649682417593,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Константин Шитьков","userId":"04248095687395188930"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def argmax(vec):\n","    # return the argmax as a python int\n","    _, idx = torch.max(vec, 1)\n","    return idx.item()\n","\n","\n","def prepare_sequence(seq, to_ix):\n","    idxs = [to_ix[w] for w in seq]\n","    return torch.tensor(idxs, dtype=torch.long)\n","\n","\n","# Compute log sum exp in a numerically stable way for the forward algorithm\n","def log_sum_exp(vec):\n","    max_score = vec[0, argmax(vec)]\n","    max_score_broadcast = max_score.view(1, -1).expand(1, vec.size()[1])\n","    return max_score + \\\n","        torch.log(torch.sum(torch.exp(vec - max_score_broadcast)))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Pu7uU_icKzsT"},"source":["Create model\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"id":"_YMmgERNKzsU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649682418553,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":966,"user":{"displayName":"Константин Шитьков","userId":"04248095687395188930"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["class BiLSTM_CRF(nn.Module):\n","\n","    def __init__(self, vocab_size, tag_to_ix, embedding_dim, hidden_dim):\n","        super(BiLSTM_CRF, self).__init__()\n","        self.embedding_dim = embedding_dim\n","        self.hidden_dim = hidden_dim\n","        self.vocab_size = vocab_size\n","        self.tag_to_ix = tag_to_ix\n","        self.tagset_size = len(tag_to_ix)\n","\n","        self.word_embeds = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)\n","        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim // 2,\n","                            num_layers=1, bidirectional=True)\n","\n","        # Maps the output of the LSTM into tag space.\n","        self.hidden2tag = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, self.tagset_size)\n","\n","        # Matrix of transition parameters.
